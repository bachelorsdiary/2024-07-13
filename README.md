Last night  I tried to sleep as early as possible, as I have to wake up in the morning for the conference about internship,scheduled at 9:30.i reached there on  time with in sufficient sleep,and some doubts in mind that what kind of questions they will ask whether questions will be asked to one by one or collectively, whether questions will be in English and everyone will have to answer it in English .I was anxious about these questions since I could not able to speak english fluently. I entered the conference hall,take a sit  and observed college mate and interviewer I realised ,more or less all of them were anxious and underconfident as I am except the interviewer I got relax and listen carefully whatever they were explaining to the audience, first 20 minutes they only talked about the company ,area of work , moto and asked someone  basic questioned related to it but no one answered to any of the questions  they were asking.then they moved topic and asked what kind of technology are  going to be relevant in future and why the placement  rate  is eight percent in India but no one has courage to answers it or even tried including me. I knew some the answer but I didn't find courage to speak in hindi . Interviewer answered all of the questions.then comes to end of the conference and talked little bit  about the internship they  are going to provide and topic related to internship and also briefly explain how these internship will help in getting a job, conference ended.what trouble  the most while coming out form confrence if i would be good at English I could manage to answers all  the question . Since I knew all the answers and  also knew that there is no  language barriers.i kewn my weakness and strength before the conference but after the conference I get experienced too.but what are the my strength frome where I get .let's talk about,what I knew about myself is that i can engage multiple topic,since my childhood I was very curious and listen my elder carefully asked  several questions and  they take the trouble to answer me,and used to ask several questions to myself try get answers some time I find myself,some it didn't then I go to my elder ask them ,most of them very friendly to me ,I never felt ignorent.and also I used to read news paper daily in Rajesh shop which present in my locality and discuss with them,the person which had influenced me the most in childhood was elder brother Nehal,in my home my brother talk about different things like Bollywood movie ,stars,poltics, economy, power dynamic of my village, cricket, clothes,food,city,that draw my attention every thing they  talk. That taught me alot. I had been madrasa for study in growing  year where they  focussed only Islamic studies they never taught about the things which brother talked at home .after completing my madrasa I have been enrolled in school at the age of 15 in eight standard
