Last night, I tried to sleep as early as possible, as I had to wake up early in the morning for the conference about internships, scheduled at 9:30 a.m. I reached there on time with insufficient sleep and many questions in mind: What kind of questions will they ask? Will questions be asked individually or collectively? Will the questions be in English, and will everyone have to answer in English? I was anxious about these questions since I was not able to speak English fluently. I entered the conference hall, took a seat, and observed my classmates and the presenter. I realized that, more or less, all of them were as anxious and underconfident as I was, except for the interviewer. I relaxed and listened carefully to whatever they were explaining to the audience. For the first 20 minutes, they only talked about the company, its area of work, and its motto, and asked some basic questions related to it, but no one answered any of the questions they were asking. Then they moved on to another topic and asked what kind of technology is going to be relevant in the future and why the placement rate is eight percent in India. However, no one had the courage to answer or even try, including me. I knew some of the answers, but I didn’t find the courage to speak, even in Hindi. The interviewer answered all the questions. Then came the end of the conference, and they talked a little bit about the internship they were going to provide and related topics. They also briefly explained how these internships would help in getting a job. The conference ended. What troubled me the most while coming out of the conference was that if I were good at English, I could have managed to answer all the questions since I knew all the answers. I also knew that there was no language barrier. I knew my weaknesses and strengths before the conference, but after the conference, I gained some experience too. But what are my strengths, and where do they come from? Let’s talk about it. What I know about myself is that I can engage in multiple topics. Since my childhood, I have been very curious and listened to my elders carefully, asking them several questions, and they took the trouble to answer me. I used to ask several questions to myself and try to find answers. Sometimes I would find the answers, and sometimes I wouldn’t, so I would go to my elders and ask them. Most of them were very friendly to me, and I never felt ignored. I also used to read the newspaper daily at Rajesh’s shop, which was in my locality, and discuss with them. The person who influenced me the most in childhood was my elder brother, Nehal. At home, my brother talked about different things like Bollywood movie stars, politics, the economy, the power dynamics of my village, cricket, clothes, food, and the city. Everything they talked about drew my attention and taught me a lot. I studied at a madrasa during my growing years, where they focused only on Islamic studies and never taught about the things my brother talked about at home. After completing my madrasa, I enrolled in school at the age of 15 in the eighth standard.
